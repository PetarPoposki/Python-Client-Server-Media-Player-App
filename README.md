Python Client/Server Media Player App

To make the application work, you need to create 2 folders in the folder where you place the server.py script:
1. "songs" which would hold the .wav audio files that you wish to play
2. "images" which would contain the .png image files that should have the exact same names as the audio files in order for it to work
You have to manually add the files which you want the server to be able to play to clients.

You should also create 2 empty folders called "clientimages" and "clientsongs" in the folder where you place the client.py script
