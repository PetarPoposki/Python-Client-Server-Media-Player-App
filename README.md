# Python-Client-Server-Media-Player-App
Python Client/Server Media Player App

To make the application work, you need to create 2 folders in the folder where you place the server.py script:
1. "songs" which would hold the .wav audio files that you wish to play.
2. "images" which would contain the .png image files that should have the exact same names as the audio files, in order for the app to work
You have to manually add the files which you want the server to be able to play to clients.

You should also create 2 empty folders called "clientimages" and "clientsongs" in the folder where you place the client.py script


The following is a Google Drive link from which you can download the entire project:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Beup9wpe1tU4GfiHUvaZA4m-gcoMpL6L/view?usp=sharing

After this, you only need to install 3 custom Python libraries:

python -m pip install tk

python -m pip install glob2

python -m pip install pyaudio

And you will have everything you need to run the project.
